# Plotly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## The purpose:

Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
Parse data in JSON format.
Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

### Synopsis:

In this module , we have learned how to craete data visualizations for the web. As a data professional we not only need to analyse data and draw conclusions from them but also need to visualise the data in order to communicate the findings to an audience. Although tools like pandas and matpl,otlib are very powerful, data findings are njot easy to share as they can be. In order to intereact with the data , our audience usually needs to have Python installed on their computer.

In this module , we have used the power of javascript to create data visualisations that are attractive , accessible, and interactive. We have used ployly.js, a javascript data visualisation library . Libraries like plotly offers interactivity which can help audience better understand our data and draw the same conclusion that we did.We have also built on our javascript foundation to manipulate , parse , and transform data. We have used javascript to create interactive features such as buttons and dropdown menus as well as to retrieve data from external sources like csv files and APIs.

Finally we have deployed a data visualisation to the web while using the power of the javascript:
